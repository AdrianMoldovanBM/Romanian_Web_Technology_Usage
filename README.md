# Web Technology Usage Trends in Romania 2024

Using **PowerBI**, I created an in-depth dashboard analyzing the technology landscape of Romanian websites, offering insights into the tools and platforms powering the country’s digital experience.
For this project, I analyzed a dataset containing **937K websites** using **211 different technologies** across **24 technology areas**.

Here are some key insights from my analysis:

**Top Technologies:**

**Google Analytics** leads by a substantial margin, used on 37% of Romanian websites.

**WordPress** follows at 27%, while **WooCommerce** supports 7%, 

**Technology Usage by Category:**

**Open Source CMS** tops the list, implemented on over 209K sites, highlighting the country’s preference for customizable, accessible solutions.

**Audience Measurement** tools are in place on 147K sites, showing a strong focus on understanding user behavior.

**Application Performance** technologies round out the top three, used by 138K sites, emphasizing a commitment to reliability and optimized user experiences.

This project has been a fantastic opportunity to dive into data-driven insights and explore Romania’s evolving digital landscape.
